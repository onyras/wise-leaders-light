# Wise Leaders Fellowship - Project Context

> Reference document for Claude Code sessions. Last updated: January 2026

---

## Project Overview

Building the website for the **Wise Leaders Fellowship** (WLF), a year-round leadership community for founder CEOs. The site is hosted via GitHub: `https://github.com/onyras/Wise_Leader_light/`

**Target audience:** Founder CEOs with 20+ employees, €2M+ ARR, who have "outgrown standard advice."

---

## Key Positioning Shift

We recently updated from a **9-month cohort program** to a **year-round membership community**.

### Old Model
- 9-month bounded program
- Linear journey with start/end
- "Fellowship" as a cohort experience

### New Model
- Ongoing annual membership (€15,000/year)
- Cyclical rhythm that repeats each year
- "Circle" or "Fellowship" as a continuous community
- Core philosophy: *"Leadership is not a problem to solve. It is a practice to sustain."*

| Peer Pods | Monthly (2 hours) | 4-5 CEOs, facilitated |
| Expert Sessions | Bi-monthly (90 min, virtual) | 6x per year |

## Key Files

### In GitHub Repo
- `index-full.html` - Main website file
- `hero-radar-v2.html` - Previous hero animation (radar chart)

### New Files (from this session)
- `hero-rhythm-wheel-v3.html` - Latest hero animation (annual wheel)
- `hero-rhythm-wheel-v2.html` - Minimal version (no text)
- `hero-rhythm-wheel-v1.html` - First version (too busy)
- `hero-radar-v3.html` - Radar with updated copy
- `WLF-Brand-Design-System.md` - Full brand guidelines

---

## Design Decisions Made

1. **Hero animation:** Moved from radar chart (tied to "measure" messaging) to annual rhythm wheel (shows year-round nature)

2. **Rhythm wheel design:** 
   - Circular track with 12 months
   - Green arc = January Silent Retreat
   - Orange arc = September Performance Retreat
   - Blue markers = Expert Sessions (bi-monthly)
   - Gray dots = Monthly Peer Pods
   - Center shows "2026 / Annual Rhythm"
   - Pulsing indicator shows current position

3. **Visual metaphors:** Shifting from linear expansion to cyclical/orbital

4. **Testimonials consideration:** May need updating to reflect multi-year membership ("This is my third year...")

---

## Open Questions

- Phase 2 background image: Current technical workspace feels too corporate. Considering library/books, architectural interiors, or intimate workshop settings. Not nature (too connected to Phase 1).

---

## Session History

- **Session 19:** Updated brand positioning document, began copy conversion from cohort to membership model, updated Hero section, created rhythm wheel animation

---

## Quick Reference: New Messaging

**Core message:** "You don't need more advice. You need space to think."

**Value prop:** A year-round community of vetted CEOs doing inner and outer work together through retreats, biomarker analysis, expert sessions, and peer coaching.

**Differentiation:** Not a typical CEO peer group focused on tactical problem-solving. This is about inner development, personal transformation, and sustained practice.
