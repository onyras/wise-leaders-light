# Wise Leaders Fellowship - Feedback Log

## Feedback from Moritz Bierling - January 22, 2026

### 1. Testimonials Section (Fellows Grid)
**Issue:** "I think this needs better social proof and links"
**Context:** Section showing 6 portrait sketches of fellows
**Action needed:**
- Add social proof elements (LinkedIn links, company info, titles)
- Add clickable links to fellow profiles or testimonials
- Consider adding company logos or credentials

### 2. Home Section / Art of Accomplishment Reference
**Issue:** "I mean, maybe you don't want them to head out from the website"
**Secondary comment:** "but I think for now visit those names won't mean anything"
**Context:** Section mentioning "Art of Accomplishment" with founders Joe Hudson & Brett Kistler
**Email shown:** info@artofaccomplishment.com
**Action needed:**
- Reconsider external links strategy - balance between credibility and keeping users on site
- Add more context about who these names are (brief credentials/bio)
- Consider making names more meaningful to visitors who don't know them

### 3. Structure Section (Three Dark Cards)
**Issue:** "make these buttons 'learn more' 'explore topics' 'see details' line up"
**Context:** Three-card layout showing:
  - Card 1: "Diagnostics" (with circular icon, "Pre-retreat" label, "Learn more →")
  - Card 2: "Your Report" (with bar chart, "Year-round" label, "Explore topics →")
  - Card 3: "Your Action Plan" (with checkmark, "Post" label, "See details →")
**Action needed:**
- Standardize CTA button text across all three cards
- Align buttons vertically so they're at the same height
- Ensure consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

### 4. Structure Section (Same Three Cards - Additional)
**Issue:** Same button alignment issue reiterated at 18:55
**Action needed:**
- Priority fix: Make the three buttons ("learn more" / "explore topics" / "see details") align horizontally
- Consider using same button text for consistency (e.g., all "Learn more →" or all "See details →")
