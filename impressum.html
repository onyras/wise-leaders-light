                <p>
                    The European Commission provides a platform for online dispute resolution (OS):
                    <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are not willing or obliged to participate in dispute resolution proceedings before a consumer arbitration board.
                </p>

                <h2>Liability for Content</h2>
                <p>
                    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 paragraph 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.
                </p>

                <h2>Liability for Links</h2>
                <p>
                    Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
                </p>
